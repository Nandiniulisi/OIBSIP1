            <p align="justify"><br/>Augmented reality (AR) is an interactive experience that combines the real world and computer-generated content.The content can span multiple sensory modalities, including visual, auditory, haptic, somatosensory and olfactory. AR can be defined as a system that incorporates three basic features: a combination of real and virtual worlds, real-time interaction, and accurate 3D registration of virtual and real objects.The overlaid sensory information can be constructive (i.e. additive to the natural environment), or destructive (i.e. masking of the natural environment).<br/>
            This experience is seamlessly interwoven with the physical world such that it is perceived as an immersive aspect of the real environment.In this way, augmented reality alters one's ongoing perception of a real-world environment, whereas virtual reality completely replaces the user's real-world environment with a simulated one.Augmented reality is largely synonymous with mixed reality. There is also overlap in terminology with extended reality and computer-mediated reality.</p>

            <p align="justify"><br/><br/>The terms virtual reality and augmented reality get thrown around a lot.<br/>In AR user is immersed in mix of the real &virtual world,but in VR is entirely in virtual world<br/>In AR,interacting with both worlds clearly.but,not in VR.<br/>In AR smartphones,tablets are devices to experience AR.but in VR head mounted display.<br/>VR headsets, such as the Meta Quest 2 or the Valve Index, and AR apps and games, such as Pokemon Go, are popular.-> They sound similar, and as the technologies develop, they bleed into each other in some ways.</p>
